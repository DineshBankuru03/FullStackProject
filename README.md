## 7. Deployment & Usage

### Setup Instructions

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Navigate to project directory:

   ```bash
   cd crave-icecream
   npm install express cors
   ```
3. Start server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open `index.html` in browser (customer view).
5. Open `admin.html` in browser (admin view).

### Deployment Options

* Host server on **Heroku / Render / Azure Web Apps**.
* Host frontend on **Netlify / GitHub Pages / Azure Storage**.
* Connect them via correct server URL in `script.js` and `admin.html`.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

* **CORS enabled** for local development.
* Input validation ensures orders require flavor & price.
* No authentication (future enhancement).
* Data stored in JSON, not production-grade database ‚Üí suitable only for small-scale/demo use.

---

## 9. Testing & Validation

* **Frontend:**

  * Verified draggable menu works smoothly.
  * Confirmed hover overlay animations.
  * Checked popup dismissal after 3s.

* **Backend:**

  * Tested API endpoints using Postman.
  * Ensured orders persist across sessions.

* **Admin Panel:**

  * Confirmed orders removed after confirmation/cancellation.
  * Popup feedback tested successfully.
